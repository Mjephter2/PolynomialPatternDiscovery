# **Polynomial Pattern Discovery** (CSCI334 Queens College, Fall 2021)

Given a set of pairs *`(Xi, Yi)`*, we can find a polynomial `f` such that  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `f := Xi -> Yi`  
This repo exhibits an implementation of finding such polynomial. Derivation is done using the formula found on page 50 of [Information-Statistical Data Mining: Warehouse Integration with Examples of Oracle
Basics, Bon K. Sy and Arjun K. Gupta](https://books.google.com/books?id=Qwo2mFAn7AEC&dq=bon+sy+data+mining&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hrU-VeuDGZX-yQT2y4HQDQ&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA)
